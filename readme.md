**Concordia_Game**

### Requisites

I don't use Windows OS for development. This guide will help you to compile the test on Linux /Mac OS

You will need:

- SFML;
- GCC compiler (g++).

To get the latest SFML library:

```
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

To get the GCC compiler (g++):

```
sudo apt install g++
```

### Compiling

To run this project, you will may want to compile it first. To do so, go to the root of the project folder via terminal and run the following:

```
make
```

And then, to execute it, you need to be at the **root of the project folder**. Then, run the following:

```
./bin/ConcordiaGame
```
